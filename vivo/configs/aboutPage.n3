        """<h2>About Scholars@UNCW</h2>
        <div class=\"pageGroupBody\" id=\"aboutText\">
            <p>Scholars@UNCW is designed to showcase the scholarship and research activities of current UNCW faculty, to share areas of research expertise, and to connect faculty and researchers with common interests to each other. The system is an implementation of <a href="https://duraspace.org/vivo/">VIVO</a>, a member-supported, open source software and an ontology for representing scholarship. <a href="https://library.uncw.edu">Randall Library</a> developed and maintains the implementation for UNCW, in collaboration with other offices including <a href="https://uncw.edu/irp/ir/index.html">Institutional Research and Planning</a> and the <a href="https://uncw.edu/research/">Office of Research and Innovation</a>. Scholars@UNCW draws directly on data entered into UNCW's implementation of <a href="https://uncw.edu/irp/ie/resources/digital-measures.html">Digital Measures/Faculty Success.</a></p>
        </div>
        <h2>Who is included in Scholars@UNCW?</h2>
        <div class=\"pageGroupBody\">
            <p>Currently only faculty from the College of Health and Human Services and Randall Library are included in Scholars@UNCW as part of the pilot rollout. Other departments and colleges will be added as long as faculty in those areas have data in Digital Measures/Faculty Success. UNCW faculty from all ranks are included.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>How can incomplete or inaccurate faculty profiles be fixed?</h2>
        <div class=\"pageGroupBody\">
            <p>Since the data is coming directly from Digital Measures/Faculty Success, any corrections or additions should be made in that system. The data in Scholars@UNCW will refresh nightly. For information on how to update or correct your data in Digital Measures, please contact Allison Kittinger, Scholarly Communications Librarian at (<a mailto="kittingera@uncw.edu">kittingera@uncw.edu</a>).
