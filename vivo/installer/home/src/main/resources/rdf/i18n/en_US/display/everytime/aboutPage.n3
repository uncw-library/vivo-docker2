        """<h2>About Scholars@UNCW</h2>
        <div class=\"pageGroupBody\" id=\"aboutText\">
            <p>Scholars@UNCW is a scholarly profile platform designed to showcase the research, creative, and teaching activities of current University of North Carolina Wilmington faculty. It also allows faculty to share areas of research expertise and to connect people with common scholarly interests across campus. The system is an implementation of <a href="https://duraspace.org/vivo/">VIVO</a>, a member-supported, open source software and an ontology for representing scholarship. <a href="https://library.uncw.edu">UNCW Library</a> developed and maintains the implementation for UNCW, in collaboration with other offices including <a href="https://uncw.edu/irp/ir/index.html">Institutional Research and Planning</a> and the <a href="https://uncw.edu/research/">Office of Research and Innovation</a>. Scholars@UNCW draws directly on data entered into <a href="https://uncw.edu/about/university-administration/academic-affairs/division/areas/irp/resources-tools/faculty-success">Watermark Faculty Success</a>.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Who is included in Scholars@UNCW?</h2>
        <div class=\"pageGroupBody\">
            <p>Profiles are automatically generated for faculty from all UNCW departments, colleges, and centers. Faculty from all ranks are included.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>How can incomplete or inaccurate faculty profiles be fixed?</h2>
        <div class=\"pageGroupBody\">
            <p>Because Scholars@UNCW relies on data from <a href="https://uncw.edu/about/university-administration/academic-affairs/division/areas/irp/resources-tools/faculty-success">Watermark Faculty Success</a>, any corrections or additions should be made in that system. The data in Scholars@UNCW refreshes nightly. For information on how to update or correct your data in Watermark Faculty Success, please consult <a href="https://libguides.uncw.edu/scholars_editing">this guide.</a></p>
        </div>
        <h2>Who supports scholarly activity at UNCW?</h2>
        <div class=\"pageGroupBody\">
            <p>Along with department- and college-specific services, UNCW Library and UNCW Research & Innovation provide infrastructure and support for scholarship across campus.
